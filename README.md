I have environments without a scheduled date. Can I update these to include a date?<br>
Yes, if you have a global admin, Dynamics 365 admin, or Power Platform admin role for the tenant, select the environment, and select a date by clicking on the reschedule transition date button.

We will update the portal with the date to confirm. Notification e-mails will also be sent to the global tenant admins as you get close to the transition date. This will follow the standard reminder procedure detailed within this document.

Is there a recommended checklist I should run through before transition?<br>
Check out the supporting content available on the community site. We also have a transition checklist to help you plan effectively. Review it carefully to ensure that you are comfortable with the transition to Unified Interface.
